# Movie Revenue Prediction

How much revenue will this movie make?

What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

To answer this question, our team used a dataset from kaggle 'TMDB 5000 movies", a dataset that has information about the (budget', 'genres'....etc) of movies. Using this dataset, we first cleaned the data using one hotend coding to organize categorical data. After this we used visualization techniques to get a better grasp about what our data mainly described. 

Finally we used Linear Regression to create a Machine Learning Model that predicted a Movie's future revenue.
